# 5GCore Project on AWS EKS

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a 5G network core using Cloud Native principles and dataplane tools such as eBPF and VPP/DPDK. The entire setup is deployed on the AWS EKS infrastructure.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to leverage the benefits of Cloud Native and dataplane tools to optimize the performance and flexibility of the 5G network core. By using AWS EKS, we can easily manage, deploy, and scale our application.

## Technologies Used

- **5GCore**: The core of our 5G network.
- **Cloud Native**: We use Cloud Native principles to facilitate the deployment, management, and scaling of our application.
- **eBPF**: A dataplane tool that allows us to create custom flow control programs.
- **VPP/DPDK**: Another dataplane tool that helps us optimize our network performance.
- **AWS EKS**: Our chosen infrastructure for deploying and managing our application.
